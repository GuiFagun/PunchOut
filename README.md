PunchOut - Project from the 1st bimester of Object Oriented Programming 2.

Developed in C#, it uses the MOO ICT tutorial at (https://www.mooict.com/c-tutorial-create-a-simple-punch-out-style-boxing-game-in-visual-studio/) as a base.

Relevant additions:
1- Theme music for the fight, victory scene and defeat scene.
2- Sound effects for punches landed, punches missed, blocking and punches taken.
3- Interval between punches to prevent the game from becoming too easy.
4- Greater naturalness in enemy movement and animations.
5- 60-second round timer.
6- Victory and defeat counter.
7- Special scenes for player victory and defeat.
8- Real transparency for the player and enemy sprites, because in Visual Studio, picture boxes do not have real transparency, only reflecting the background image and causing overlap in the images behind. This problem has been fixed.

Controls:
↓ = Block.
→ = Right punch.
← = Left punch.
To restart the game = Click OK in the pop-up shown after the end of a fight.
